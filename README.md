Did you ever think of portable mouse and full keyboard? 
which could be in your packet and be with you everywhere! but why? 
idk somtimes we need to seem more cool than others, i mean come on, that
looks very cool, but in otherhand, in this modern world most of electronic devieces 
have they own os like winodws, linux and ... and somtimes they dont have touch screen or
good HID so i decided to build this bad ass gadget...

## this project preneed
+ Arduino Leonardo
+ Joystick
+ Oled 0.75
________________
+ Arduino IDE
( to run project open the arduino ide on pc or open arduinoDroid on android os 
and upload the project to the complited board )

## menu part
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4a3d409f-a793-46fd-91ce-2f06b6baa3a4)
This part is the menu, we can select and press the joystick to enter 
( you have to press joystick's button to left to quit )

## Mouse

you can use the joystick as a normal mouse and even click 

## Keyboard

i put a-z characters + space/enter and backspace and you can switch between them by moving joystick
but becarful to change the target device keyboard language to en layout 

## Special Keyboard
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/304783ca-4615-4723-85a8-1a51d08cb391)
so i thought why should i build a keyboard which cannot even open the bootmenu of windows?
when you press a button it press it until you click on '-R' button or go back to normal Keyboard and press
a button there.

## Brute F0rcer

i know we cannot name every for loop as a brute forcer but why not?

## Auto Clicker
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a4bbd46-26d9-48b2-91e9-a0406235cbee)
and this is a very simple auto clicker wich clicks until you quit 
it inputs the delay you want between every clicks and it counts from 5 to 0 
and then it starts clicking. 
Tests: (21CPS, 105 Clicks in 5 ) ( most of games recieves less than 10CPS ) 







So i hope you enjoyed this beginning project of mine.
